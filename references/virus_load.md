# Virus Load: Summary of Papers

Ordered by year and author.

- Smith, A. P., Moquin, D. J., Bernhauerova, V., & Smith, A. M. (2018). Influenza virus infection model with density dependence supports biphasic viral decay. Frontiers in Microbiology, 9(JUL), 1–10. https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2018.01554/full

  > Generalization of Baccam's standard viral kinetic model with nonconstant clearance rate of infected cells. The clearance function is given by a saturation term on the productively infected cells.

  > Review of virus load models.

  > Follow-up developement of the standard viral kinetic model to account for a shoulder phase (triphasic) developed for long-term HCV viral kinetics. The model now includes saturation terms and noninfectious virions.

- Baccam, P., Beauchemin, C., Macken, C. A., Hayden, F. G., & Perelson, A. S. (2006). Kinetics of Influenza A Virus Infection in Humans. Journal of Virology, 80(15), 7590–7599. https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01623-05
  
  > Viral kinetic model with delayed virus production developed for Influenza A virus. The model includes a population of infected cells that do not produce virus yet (eclipse phase) capturing two peaks in the viral titer.

- Neumann, A. U., Lam, N. P., Dahari, H., Gretch, D. R., Wiley, T. E., Layden, T. J., & Perelson, A. S. (1998). Hepatitis C viral dynamics in vivo and the antiviral efficacy of interferon-α therapy. Science, 282(5386), 103–107. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.282.5386.103

  > Main reference for the standard viral kinetic model developed for HCV. The model consist on ODEs (law of mass-action) for the virus load, productively infected cells, and target cells; and captures biphasic behaviour (clearance and death). They find that early IFN treatment is crucial in the efficientcy of patient treatment.

  > One of the first references for the standard vial kinetic model developed for HIV.
